        <div class="desc">Roald Dahl's The Witches is a 2020 dark fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis, Kenya Barris, and Guillermo del Toro. It is based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl and is the second feature-length adaptation of the novel, after the 1990 film of the same name directed by Nicolas Roeg. The film stars Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, and Stanley Tucci, and is narrated by Chris Rock.
            The Witches was released on HBO Max in the United States on October 22, 2020,[3][4] and was released theatrically from October 28, 2020. It received mixed reviews from critics, who deemed it inferior to Roeg's film, though Hathaway's performance received praise.</div>
